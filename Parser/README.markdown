DEPENDENCIES
============
So, we have several ways to solve the dependencies for this parser.

If you do not have haskell instaled you should begin with:

Install [Haskell Platform](http://hackage.haskell.org/platform/ "haskell platform") then we need to install Language.C
	
	sudo cabal install language-c

If you do Have haskell installed:
If you run on MacOSX you should do:

	sudo port install cabal
	sudo cabal install language-c

If you are on Ubuntu Linux:
	
	sudo aptitude install cabal
	sudo cabal install language-c



and then you are ready to go :)
