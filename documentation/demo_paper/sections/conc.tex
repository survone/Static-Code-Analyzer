The submission plataform, is already a very mature application, mainly when accessed by the Web Interface.
%It as some interesting goodies, such as the submission of exercices by \textXML, and the clone detection.
In spite of not being the most important part of the tool, it does all that a normal submission
plataform for programming contests should do.
The metrics calculation application is now able to calculate a set of metrics. Several quality notions can be infered using this metrics.
This interpretation is not yet available, being this one of the planed features to be implemented in our tool.
