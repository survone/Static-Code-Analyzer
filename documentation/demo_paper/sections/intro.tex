\section{Introduction}
Quantitative measurements are essential in all sciences, and computer science is no exception.
Although Software Metrics aren't often used in Software Development, there has been an effort on the computer science community to develop and improve this metrics. 
The goal is to make them valuable in many aspects, such as quality assurance.\\
We present a static code analyser, that by measuring a set of metrics over C code, will give a notion of quality to the user.\\
A system for managing programming contests, was chosen as the case study.
The competitors submit source code, which is their attempt to resolve the given problem.
The goal is not only to check if the solution is correct, but also evaluate the quality of the submited code.
